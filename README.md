Employee database – this option allows you to store employee data in a database (SQlite). The second segment Salary Calculation – this option enables the calculation of the monthly salary based on already entered employee data in the Employee database option. The third segment, Employee identity cards – this option allows us to prepare and print an employee identification card based on the employee data entered from the Employee database.
